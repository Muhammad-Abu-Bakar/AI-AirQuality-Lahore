🌱 Phase 1 — Foundation (Week 1–2)
Step 1: Understand the problem context

Study Lahore’s air quality profile — what are the main pollutants, sources, and seasonal patterns?

Read 2–3 local research papers (I can list them if you’d like).

Learn why PM2.5 is the main issue and which factors drive it (temperature, humidity, vehicles, crop burning).

Write a short 1-page summary answering:

What are the main air quality issues in Lahore?

Why is forecasting important?

How can AI help?

💡 This summary later becomes your introduction section in your PhD proposal.

🧩 Phase 2 — Data collection & exploration (Week 2–4)
Step 2: Gather your first dataset

Start small — focus on 1–2 years of daily PM2.5 + meteorological data.
Here’s where to get it:

OpenAQ API → provides hourly/daily AQ data for Lahore.

ERA5 or NASA POWER → weather data (wind, temperature, humidity).

Optional later: Satellite data (Sentinel-5P NO₂, MODIS AOD).

I can give you ready-to-use Python code to collect and merge this data — just say “yes, please.”

Step 3: Explore the data

Plot daily PM2.5 over time, check missing values, look for trends (seasonal spikes).

Correlate PM2.5 with temperature, humidity, wind speed.

Make 2–3 key graphs:

Time series of PM2.5

Correlation heatmap

Seasonal averages (monthly or weekday pattern)

💡 This becomes your data and methods section in your proposal.

🤖 Phase 3 — Theoretical model design (Week 4–8)
Step 4: Start with simple models

Begin with persistence (today’s value = tomorrow’s forecast).

Then build:

Linear regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluate using RMSE and MAE.

Step 5: Move to AI forecasting

Try a LSTM model (deep learning for time series).

Compare results with baseline models.

Focus on understanding feature impact (e.g., SHAP or permutation importance).

💡 You don’t need perfection yet — you need to show a working pipeline and theoretical understanding.

🧠 Phase 4 — Theoretical insights → Control ideas (Week 8–10)
Step 6: Analyze what your model says

Which variables matter most? (wind, humidity, etc.)

When are spikes most likely?

Write your interpretation — why the model makes those predictions.

Then brainstorm control actions:

Example: if low wind + high humidity + crop burning = predicted spike → suggest traffic restrictions.

💻 Phase 5 — Optional small prototype (Month 3–4)
Step 7: Visualization / dashboard (optional)

If you have time:

Build a Streamlit dashboard showing:

Current AQI

Forecast for next 3 days

Model explanations (top 3 contributing factors)

This converts your theory → practical decision-support tool.

📝 Phase 6 — Proposal writing (Month 4–5)
Step 8: Draft your proposal

Structure:

Timeline & resources

🚀 What you should do right now

✅ Pick Step 1 — start reading about Lahore’s air pollution (I can list 3–5 recent studies).

📦 Then Step 2 — I’ll help you collect your first dataset with Python.

Would you like me to give you:

(A) 5 recommended research papers about Lahore’s air pollution, or

(B) Python code to start collecting OpenAQ + weather data for Lahore?

We’ll start there and move upward.
